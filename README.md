# SMAP API Deployment code

## This is the smap-api deployment code for AWS Lambda

### NOTE:
Please use another branch for development. You should create branches from the master branch, which can be merged back into master once development in the new branch is complete.

### To Be Modified:
The workflow has been setup. Now we only need to modify the get, post, put, delete methods in their corresponding method packages under the "handlers" package.
